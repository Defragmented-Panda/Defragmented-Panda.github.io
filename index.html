A truss frame, similar to scaffolding is used for it strength and lightness, and plastic barrels as floater and many such modules can be connected together

Joists that hold the wooden floor from a pallet wood are less critical so their connection is lighter

For minimal weight and heat transfer, maximum natural light a membrane wall is used. Membrane wall consist of compressed PE film for insulator at the middle, strapping line for reinforcement and tarpaulin for UV and weather protection.

<h2>Some tech details for nerds:</h2>
<h3>Steel</h3>
	M12 bolt with 4.8 property class proof load is 26100N
<br>
	Nut exceeds the strength of bolt so it is ignored
<br>
	Soft steel with 400 MPa tensile strength is used for plates
<br>
 No surface protection is used because it is a prototype. Later hot dip zinc cover will be used to match the lifespan of the steel to those of the wood
<br>
	Hot glue is used between steel and wood to increase friction to 1.7, no adhesion is taken into account because it does not increase the joint strength, but it can be considered a safety measure in case of the bolt failure
<br>
	All joints are made friction-only, no shear load is applied to the bolts
<br>
<br>
<h3>Wood</h3>
	Softwood beam sizes are 40mm*80mm and compression strength of 40 Mpa is taken because it is smaller than tension strength and sign-changing load is expected
<br>
	All wood between steel plates is compressed with 4 Mpa, which is larger than EU recommendation of 2.5 Mpa, but match the practical tests and the rest of the world standards
<br>
 Sizes of the structure match the sizes of a shipping container to allow transporting when assembled, width is 2.4m
<br>
	Most twisting and bending load is converted into tension and compression because of the truss structure, with the exception of the cargo load on the floor, wind load on the walls and floating barrels load on the floor
<br>
	Infinite beams idea is utilized, allowing to transfer load by the beam further from it appearance until load is distributed on many such modules
<br>
	No wood treatment is used at this point for the prototype
<br>
<br>
<h3>Plastic</h3>
	Weak PP strapping line of 12mm*1mm and 100kg maximum load are used, because any higher load will break the beam they are attached to
<br>
	Membrane is glued together by hot glue, strapping line to the tarpaulin, because very few glues can attach to PP and then be removed if needed
<br>
 UV resistant and visibly transparent paint is used on the tarpaulin because it is easier than making the thermal insulator UV resistant completely
<br>
 Crumpled PE film is used as insulator because of it transparency, thicker walls than PS foam result in less light scattering
<br>
	Insulator is also used as soundproofing and vibration dampening from the outer membrane in case of wind vibration
<br>
	Insulator made of crumpled PE film is using a pillow case made of a layer of the same film to avoid the dust accumulation inside
<br>
<br>
<h3>Weights assuming a corner module, two walls, floor and ceiling</h3>
Insulator 30kg
<br>
Timber frame 70kg
<br>
Steel connectors 30kg
<br>
Plastic barrels 40kg
<br>
Wooden floor 60kg
<br>
Tarpaulin 30kg
<br>
Strapping line 5kg
<br>
Total 265 kg
